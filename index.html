                    <p>This letter is a testament of our journey that we have started a year ago. The happiness, the sadness, the growth, and everything in between.</p>
                    <p>You turned my whole life upside down when you came into it, and I didn't even mind it. Not at all. You've turned every ordinary thing into something extraordinary. You taught me that love is a choice that we make everyday. To that, I choose you every single day.</p>
                    <p>I love you because you make me happy, you lighten up my day, and because you give me the chance to love you the same. At the same time, I love you despite the challenges that we have encountered together in this relationship.</p>
                    <p>My darling, this marks our first year, and if you want, let's take a nostalgia trip together. Scroll down, slowly.</p>
